# search
Both Binary and Interpolation search

Interpolation Search: Works best when items are uniformally distributed T(avg)(n) = theta(loglogn), but worst case T(n) = O(n)
Binary Earch: Good for any sorted array T(n) = theta(logn)

Input: int*A, int n, int t
Both require sorted array of size n and target t
Ouput: Prints index of found item or not found
